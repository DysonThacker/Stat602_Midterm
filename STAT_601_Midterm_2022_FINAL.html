<h1>Dry Beans MidTerm Project (STAT 601 2022)</h1>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><em>This project is intended to give you practice of on choosing what class of learning algorithms to use for a given task</em></p>
<p>Work by yourself- we will set up a message board for discussions and general questions for the project.</p>
<p>You are expected to provide the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a power point your results</li>
<li>Explain the model building process</li>
<li>Provide your recommendations</li>
<li>Provide a short white paper of your model building process, the selected model, and the model’s properties for the task at hand.</li>
<li>Include annotated code that replicates your analysis.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>MAKE SURE YOU PROPERLY REFERENCE ANY MATERIAL YOU USE IN THIS PROJECT-this is an easy way to fail the project and course!!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Monday April 4, 2022 at 10am Central Time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you need additional time, or have any other concerns, please let me know sooner than later so that we can make alternative arrangements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common type of task that you will be expected to do as a Data Scientist or Analyst over one to two days time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In a recent paper, Koklu et al.&#160;explored the possibility of using morphometric measurements on seven commonly cultivated white beans to develop an automated (or at least machine assisted) method for separating the white beans when presented at market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using certified dry bean seeds in Turkey is around 10% (Bolat et al., 2017). Dry bean cultivation in Turkey and Asian countries usually in the form of populations containing mixed species of seeds. Also, there is not much certified seed planting area (Varankaya and Ceyhan, 2012). Since different populations which contain different genotypes are cultivated, the final products contain different species of seeds. Thus, when the dry bean seeds obtained from population cultivation are released to the market without being separated by species, the market value decreases immensely (Varankaya and Ceyhan, 2012). -Murat Koklu, Ilker Ali Ozkan, Multiclass classification of dry beans using computer vision and machine learning techniques, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Volume 174, 2020,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this project I would like you to explore the potential of the various learning methods we have covered to date and give a recommendation on which type of algorithm we should further develop for the task of sorting white beans. You are expected to develop an automated method that predicts the value of a harvest from a ‘population cultivation’ from a single farm that has been presented at market.</p>
<p>Since each of the beans has a different value at market the cost of a error depends on the actual type of white bean and what it is predicted class.</p>
<p>You will be expected to provide some measure of your predictive systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Data Resources and Structure</h2>
<p>For this project you will be given a sample of beans that are classified into 6 varieties of white beans at a hypothetical (ie. made up by me!) local market price per lb in USD.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Bombay ($5.56/lb)</li>
<li>Cali ($6.02/lb)</li>
<li>Dermason ($1.98/lb)</li>
<li>Horoz ($2.43/lb)</li>
<li>Seker ($2.72/lb)</li>
<li>Sira ($5.40/lb)</li>
</ol>
<p>Seed weight in grams (average gram per seed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Seker 0.49 grams/seed</li>
<li>Bombay 1.92 grams/seed</li>
<li>Cali 0.61 grams/seed</li>
<li>Horoz 0.52 grams/seed</li>
<li>Sira 0.38 grams/seed</li>
<li>Dermason 0.28 grams/seed</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that there are ~453.592 grams per pound)</p>
<p>In the paper by Koklu and Ozkan there is a seventh variety (Barbunya) that we are ignoring for this task.</p>
<p>The column Labels of the training data are as follows. Please see the provided papers for additional details.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Area: Area (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>): The area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries. <span class="math display">\[A=\sum_{r,c \in R} 1,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the size of the bean region.</li>
<li>Perimeter (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>): Bean circumference is defined as the length of its border.<br/>
</li>
<li>MajorAxisLength (Major axis length (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>)): The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean.<br/>
</li>
<li>MinorAxisLength (Minor axis length (<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>)): The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis.<br/>
</li>
<li>Eccentricity (<span class="math inline">\(Ec\)</span>): Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region.<br/>
</li>
<li>ConvexArea (Convex Area (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>)): Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed.</li>
<li>Extent (<span class="math inline">\(Ex\)</span>): The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area. <span class="math display">\[ Ex=\frac{A}{A_b},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A_b\)</span> is the Area of a bounding rectangle.</li>
<li>Class: One of the six bean types/varieties (BOMBAY, CALI, DERMASON, HOROZ, SEKER, SIRA)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Data Sets</h2>
<p>You will be provided with the following file: - <code>labeled.csv</code>: Labeled training data to build the classifiers for the task.</p>
<p><em>Please note that the labeled data has a equal number of each type of beans and there is NO REASON TO EXPECT THAT THE THREE DIFFERENT CULTIVATIONS HAVE THIS PROPERTY.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your grade will be determined by the following components:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Your power point slides presentation reviewing your approach and summarizing your recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p>The white paper, with the methods you have used in building your classifiers.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li><p>You should use multiple classification methods and document how you constructed them.</p></li>
<li><p>YOU NEED TO PROVIDE MEASURE OF THE ACCURACY OF THE METHOD IN TERMS of the PREDICTED VALUE A BEAN IN YOUR WRITE UP AND PRESENTATION!</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to turn in the following three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An annotated R-script that build your classifier off of <code>labeled.csv</code>.</li>
<li>A write-up on the construction on your classifier. (White paper approx. Max of 2 pages of written text. Tables and plots do not count towards the total page count but put tables/figures at the end of the write up and reference forward to them.)</li>
<li>A PowerPoint presentation discussing the work you have done on the project. (Including the following: Introduce and review the problem; discuss the resources you have used to solve the problem; present the algorithms you used to solve the problem; and your solutions/predictions with their corresponding accuracy.)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Do ask me (or the GTAs) for help if you are having trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware this is a rather open ended question.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Start early. Get something that works then come back and build up a better solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good Luck</p>
